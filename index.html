                    Why am I here? I am here to craft the life I have always dreamed; to fullfill a destiny; and to become the best version of
                    myself I can be in my career and personal life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I was 10 years old, I started playing with HTML for a blogging community online. In those days, geocities was the go
                    to for your host and Funky Chicken was the go to for code! I had so much fun creating a website, improving
                    the design, and learning new code to improve user expereince. In world filled with hot pink backgrounds with
                    lime green text, I quickly understood the importance of readability and design. Creating web pages that were
                    easy on the eyes and still displayed interesting design was my passion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time, I did not know web development was a career option and now, 20 years later, I am excited pursue something so
                    fun and useful. I hope to soon be building beautiful websites to support others' dreams, so they too can
                    pursue their best life!
